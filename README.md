## Usage

To add a role to yourself as a user you simply click one of the reactions on the message, and to remove yourself from that role you click again to remove your reaction on the message.

If a user has the roles (as configured below) that gives the permission to use role management commands:

### Conventions

- <> : a required parameter
- [] : an optional parameter

### Configuration

The bot is configured per server via the `configure` command.

To configure the bot, you will need:

- A channel for the bot to post the role selector messages in (e.g. `#roles`)
- One or more roles to use as permission roles for managing roles (e.g. `@role-add, @role-update, @role-remove`)
  - These can be the same role if you want to give all permissions to one role
- Is creating and removing channels enabled? (e.g. `true, false`)
- What category should the bot create new role channels in? (e.g. `üìÅ role-channels`)
  - This is only used if creating and removing channels is enabled
- One or more roles to use as permission roles for managing role channels (e.g. `@role-channel-create, @role-channel-remove`)
  - These can be the same as the role management role

#### Example

- `/role configure <role channel> <add role> <remove role> <update role> <create channel> <create channel role> <remove channel role> <channel category> <cascadeDelete>`
- `/role configure #roles @role-add @role-remove @role-update true  @role-channel-create @role-channel-remove role-channels true`

### Add Command

Adds a new role to the discord, configured as specified.

- `/role add <role name> <emoji> [colour]`

Usage examples:

- `/role add valorant :gun: #d34454`
- `/role add valorant :gun:`

### Remove Command

Removes a role, its reactions, and its channels if they exist.

- `/role remove <role>`

Usage example:

### Update Command

Modifies any one part of a role.
Where role fields are `name`, `emoji` and `color`, and role field values are valid values of those fields as per the `add` role command.

Usage examples:

- `/role update @valorant name coolgungame`
- `/role update @valorant emoji üòé`

Roles may have zero or one text channel, and zero or one voice channel associated with them.
